# Utils

The utilities are available in the root namespace automatically.

## cn

```fsharp
type Lib =
    static member cn(classes: string array): string
```

Uses clsx and tailwind-merge to resolve classes

## createChildrenResolver

```fsharp
type Lib =
    static member createChildrenResolver(
        descendants: #HtmlELement
    ): Accessor<#HtmlElement> * Accessor<bool>
```

A convenience function that combines the children() function with a
length check. Essentially, the returned tuples second value will inform you whether
you have any elements, so you do not re-evaluate the children resolver unnecessarily.


## System.Char.empty

This is a convenience extension for inserting empty spaces that won't be trimmed
by JSX compilation


## &&=

This is a convenience fable emit macro to compile '$0 && $1'. Similar to the
Fable included '??='.

## >=>

This is a convenience operator to apply a void function to a piped input, and returning the input.
Useful for printing to console etc.

```fsharp
// example
let x = 5
x
|> (+) 3
>=> (printfn "%i") // 8
|> (+) 2
>=> (printfn "%i") // 10
```

## toHtmlElement and toElement

Convenience wrappers for embedding JSX directly in elements.

The signature between the two differs, as some IDEs will offer completions on only the latter.

```fsharp
div() {
    toHtmlElement JSX.jsx "<span>embedded</span>"
}
```

```fsharp
div() {
    JSX.jsx "<span>embedded</span>" |> toElement
}
```

> Unfortunately, adding an overload for 'JSX.Element' to the Partas.Solid computations causes
> compilation errors.

## SrSpan

Convenience component that is essentially:

```fsharp
span(class' = Lib.cn [| "sr-only"; props.class' |]).spread props
```

## DV

Convenience type abbreviation for 'DefaultValueAttribute'

```fsharp
type O() =
    [<DefaultValue>]
    val mutable someProp: int
    [<DV>] val mutable prop: int
```

## Charts

Used to standardise color stepping in charts such as with the category bars, such that
consecutive data points are colored differently ubiquitously.

### ChartColor

The type of the objects in the 'color' array.

```fsharp
type ChartColor = {
    bg: string
    stroke: string
    fill: string
    text: string
}
```

Contains the different color utilities for tailwind.

### colors

The array of chart colors. See the 'ColorPalette'.
