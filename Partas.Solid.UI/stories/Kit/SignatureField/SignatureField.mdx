<Meta of={SignatureFieldStories}/>
<Title/>

A signature field with a clear button that lays above the signature to prevent
it becoming obscured, and responsive light/dark color scheme.

To achieve this, the 'fill' field of the 'drawing' prop is set unless already
existing.

Therefore, to overwrite the fill colour, you would need to specifically set
the 'fill' field on a 'DrawingOptions' object and pass it to the 'drawing' prop.

The components of the field can be styled using the 'slots' property object.
